# Pothos bindings for GNU Radio blocks

This project generates Pothos bindings for GNU Radio blocks.
It contains a build system that scans the host environment
for installed GNU Radio libraries and GRC block wrappers,
including out-of-tree projects and generates bindings.
The bindings allow the blocks to be used within
the Pothos framework API and with the Pothos GUI.
